# Stacey HTML5ived

## Description

This is a modified version of the default template for Stacey, a wonderfully simple content management system (http://staceyapp.com).

The default template (http://template1.staceyapp.com) has been updated to current markup standards (HTML5) and converted to a fluid (percentage-based) layout. 

Small deviations have been made from the original layout to align baselines and layouts between pages.

## Demo

Note: Currently installed on sub-domain that is causing **dead links to individual pages**. Main page displays correctly; still need to sort out internal links for demo...

## Updates

* Markup rewritten from ground up in HTML5
* Simplification of templates and partials
* CSS rewritten from ground up for new markup
* Updated JS
* Fluid, percentage-based layout
 * Note: Images and media have not been updated to be fluid yet.
* Utilizes [SASS](http://sass-lang.com) and [Compass](http://compass-style.org)
 * Note: SASS is not required to use the template as is. Also, the compiled CSS files can be edited to customize the template in place of the SASS masters. However if you haven't given SASS (and Compass, a library of SASS snippets) a look yet you're missing out on one of the best things to hit your CSS toolbox in a while.
* Utilizes [Modernizr](http://www.modernizr.com) and [Selectivizr](http://selectivizr.com)

For the fastidious, see full details in 'changelog.md'.
