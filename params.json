Main page displays correctly; still need to sort out internal links for demo...\r\n\r\n[Template Demonstration](http://stacey.claytonfarr.com/)\r\n\r\n## Updates\r\n\r\n* Markup rewritten from ground up in HTML5\r\n* Simplification of templates and partials\r\n* CSS rewritten from ground up for new markup\r\n* Updated JS\r\n* Fluid, percentage-based layout\r\n * Note: Images and media have not been updated to be fluid yet.\r\n* Utilizes [SASS](http://sass-lang.com) and [Compass](http://compass-style.org)\r\n * Note: SASS is not required to use the template as is. Also, the compiled CSS files can be edited to customize the template in place of the SASS masters. However if you haven't given SASS (and Compass, a library of SASS snippets) a look yet you're missing out on one of the best things to hit your CSS toolbox in a while.\r\n* Utilizes [Modernizr](http://www.modernizr.com) and [Selectivizr](http://selectivizr.com)\r\n\r\nFor the fastidious, see full details in 'changelog.md'.\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\nReplace the *'content'*, *'public'* & *'templates'* folders from the default stacey installation with the folders from this repo.\r\n\r\n## Read More\r\n\r\nSee [StaceyApp.com](http://staceyapp.com) for the wonderfully simple content management system that this template is designed for.\r\n\r\n## Copyright/License\r\n\r\nStacey (Original Template) - Copyright (c) 2009 Anthony Kolber.
